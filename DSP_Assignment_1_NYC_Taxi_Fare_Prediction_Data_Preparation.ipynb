    "This problem is about predicting a taxi trip fare in New York City. At first glance, it may seem to depend simply on the distance traveled. However, taxi vendors in New York charge varying amounts for other factors such as additional passengers or paying with a credit card instead of cash. You want to predict the price value, which is a real value, based on the other factors in the dataset. To do that, you choose a regression machine learning task."

There are six passenger_count unique-values in the data. Show a color legend to understand the plot. Use the following example, done for one passenger_count. Or use your own methods.\n",
